User Story: LEGO Block Game - Creative Stacking with Save Feature

Objective:
As a player, I want to enjoy the creative process of stacking LEGO blocks, enabling the construction of diverse structures with blocks of matching colors. Additionally, I want the ability to save my progress, including the placement of LEGO blocks, for later continuation.

Scenario: Initial Setup
1. Upon starting the game,
2. All LEGO blocks are initially hidden.
3. Subsequently, players are presented with a Color Box list for block selection.

User Interaction - Placing Blocks:
1. When players select a Color Box,
2. The corresponding LEGO block of that color appears on the floor.
3. Players can then move these blocks onto the tiles.

Interactions with Placed Blocks:
1. If a player has already placed at least one LEGO block of a specific color on the floor,
2. Double-clicking on another Color Box from the list generates a clone of the selected block.
3. Players can then drag this clone into visibility and position it as desired.

Save Feature:
1. Given that players have created a structure using LEGO blocks,
2. When they choose to save their progress,
3. The current state of the game, including the position of placed blocks, is saved for later retrieval.
